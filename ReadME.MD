Run Main.exe to run the teletext system.
The SDL 2 running time libraries are included to make the executable work.

Controls:

h -------------- show / hide keyboard

f -------------- fullscreen / windowed mode

< -------------- move left

> -------------- move right

del ------------ delete a control code
   
The .m7 files are used as command line arguments to print images in the teletext. To do this, cd to the file directory, and type "main.exe panda.m7" to run the image of a panda.
